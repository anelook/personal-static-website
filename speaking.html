									<p><i>
									DevRel, and in particular Developer Advocates, are known for their excellent public speaking skills, looking very relaxed on stage, talking smoothly on camera, and exerting a high level of calmness in front of large audiences.<br>

									But does it mean that those speakers are born that way? Definitely not! In fact, anxiety of public speaking is part of almost all of us, ranging from tolerable nervousness to paralysing fear.<br>

									Spoiler alert: as long as we care about our topic and our audience, nervousness never completely goes away. However, controlling public speaking fear is a skill that we can learn.</i>

										A columnar database ClickHouse is in many ways exceptional - it is exceptionally fast and exceptionally efficient, but also, at times, exceptionally confusing.<br>
										To get the most out of ClickHouse and avoid pitfalls, we'll talk about OLAP and architecture of columnar databases. We'll touch topics of storage, compression, indexing, searching. We'll look at reasons behind the most puzzling concepts of ClickHouse, so that by the end of the talk you find them not only logical, but maybe even fascinating.

									<h2><a href="https://www.confluent.io/events/current-2022/balance-your-data-across-apache-kafka-partitions/">Balance Your Data Across Apache Kafka Partitions</a></h2>
									<p>You can watch the full talk <a href="https://www.confluent.io/events/current-2022/balance-your-data-across-apache-kafka-partitions/">on the Confluent website</a>: <img src="images/current22.png" alt="" style="height: 200px" /> </p>
									<p><i>Apache Kafka is a distributed system. At the heart of Apache Kafka is a set of brokers, which allow to store the records persistently across different topics. Topics, in turn, are split into partitions. Dividing topics into such pieces allows us to use data from multiple partitions in parallel, so that producers and consumers can work with data simultaneously and achieve higher data throughput.<br>

										Such parallelisation is the key to a performant cluster, however it comes with a price. The thing is, reading from multiple partitions will eventually mess up the order of records, meaning that the resulting order will be different from when the data was pushed into the cluster.<br>

										This happens because when consuming data from multiple partitions, the order of partitions is not guaranteed. Instead, we must rely on the order of the records within a single partition, where the data is guaranteed to maintain the original sequence. We need to use this characteristic of Apache Kafka to our advantage in those cases where the ordering of the records is important for our system.<br>

										Therefore, when building our product architecture we should carefully weigh up how we will balance records across partitions and what mechanisms we will use to ensure that the sequence of the messages remains correct when data is read by multiple consumers.<br>

										In this talk we'll discuss mechanisms you can use to balance your data, such as keys, composite message key, role of hashing, custom partitions and other things you need to keep in mind when splitting data across partitions.<br>

										If you are fresh to Apache Kafka, or you're looking for good practices to design your topics and avoid common pitfalls, you'll find this session useful!</i></p>

									<p><i>A columnar database ClickHouse is in many ways exceptional - it is exceptionally fast, exceptionally efficient, but also, exceptionally confusing. <br>

										It's approach to handling data goes against principles we use in other databases: its primary index doesn't index each row and doesn't guarantee uniqueness; a secondary index doesn't point to specific rows; JOIN to be avoided and transactions do not exist.<br>

										But if used correctly, ClickHouse is a superb solution for online analytical processing.<br>

										The goal of this talk is to help you get the most of ClickHouse and avoid pitfalls. We'll talk about analytics, columnar databases and sparse indexing. We'll look at the most puzzling concepts of ClickHouse, so that by the end of the talk you find them not only logical, but maybe even fascinating.<br>

									<p><i>I bet almost everyone heard about Apache Kafka. So many companies use it with a big community built around this open-source distributed event streaming technology.<br>
										However, the first steps in Apache Kafka are usually not easy. The complexity and vastness of the platform makes it heard to grasp. Those who know this technology well when explaining it tend to use complex jargon and plenty of confusing terminology. This puts newcomers away and creates unnecessary frustration.<br>
										Let me explain Apache Kafka in a friendly, entertaining and enjoyable way. Because. after all, this technology is super cool!<br>

									<h2>Optimal Data Warehouse for analytics: Apache Kafka and ClickHouse</h2>
									<p><img src="images/JBCNConf.png" alt="" style="height: 250px" /></p>
									<p><i>Apache Kafka is amazing at handling real-time data feeds. However, in certain cases we need to come back to older records to analyse and process data at later times. This is challenging because storing records indefinitely and doing large scans of data in Apache Kafka is not optimal.<br>

										ClickHouse, on the other hand, is a scalable and reliable storage solution designed to handle petabytes of data and, at the same time, a powerful open-source tool for fast online analytical processing, used by many companies for data analytics. What's more ClickHouse has a built-in table engine to publish and subscribe to Apache Kafka data feeds.<br>

										Combining Apache Kafka and ClickHouse allows us to transition older records to a data warehouse in order to perform analytics at scale on top of the fresh data that Kafka provides.<br>

										In this talk you’ll learn how to use Apache Kafka together with ClickHouse and how to query the data stored in the data warehouse. This session is for those who want to perform analytics with fast response time over huge volumes of data without the need to downsample it.

									<p>You can watch the full talk <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/opensearch_dashboards/">on FOSDEM platform</a>.</p>
									<p><i>Working with Big Data means that we need tools to organise and understand the data. And you don’t have to be a developer to search, aggregate and visualise your data. Whether you need an affordable business analytics tool or you want to analyse log data in near real time, OpenSearch can help you. And all of it through a visual interface of OpenSearch Dashboards.<br>
										After listening to this talk you’ll understand the basics of working with an OpenSearch cluster and different use cases it supports. You’ll also learn to create your first search and aggregation query and visualise the outcomes with the help of OpenSearch Dashboards.<br>
										This talk is for those who have little or no previous experience of OpenSearch (and Elasticsearch) and who are looking for solutions for searching, monitoring or data analysis with no coding required.<br>
										In this session the audience will get theoretical and a knowledge on what OpenSearch is, which use cases it supports and how the audience can start using it for their data already today. Roles outside of developers are welcome, the information will be presented in uncomplicated terms and we’ll use visualisation tools to create and run requests, so no coding is required.
